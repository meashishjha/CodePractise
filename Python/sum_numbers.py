'''
Guess the number

Problem Statement: 
The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the built-in sum function. 
However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments. 
Thus, although you might invoke sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).

'''


def mysum(*args):
    totalsum = 0
    for i in args:
        totalsum += i

    return totalsum

   




if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(mysum(10,20,3,4,5))
    print(sum([1,2,3],6))
