'''
The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the built-in sum function.
However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments.
Thus, although you might invoke sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).

def mysum(*inputs):
    total_sum = 0
    for input in inputs:
        total_sum += input
    return total_sum



if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(mysum(2, 3, 7, 9, 11))
    print(mysum())
