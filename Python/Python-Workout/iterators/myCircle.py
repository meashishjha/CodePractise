'''
Define a class, Circle, that takes two arguments when defined: a sequence and a number.
The idea is that the object will then return elements the defined number of times.
If the number is greater than the number of elements, then the sequence repeats as necessary.
You should define the class such that it uses a helper (which I call CircleIterator).
